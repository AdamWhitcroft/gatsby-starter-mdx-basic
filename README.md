# Gatsby Starter MDX Less-Basic

My version of the [Gatsby Starter MDX Basic](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/gatsby-starter-mdx-basic), but with a few more features added:

- ✅ Added `gatsby-plugin-sass` for Sass support out of the box.
- ✅ Added support for programmatically generating posts from the `posts` folder.
- ✅ Added support page slugs.
